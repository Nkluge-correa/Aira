# Ai.ra - the AIRES Expert

![image-gif](https://media1.giphy.com/media/S60CrN9iMxFlyp7uM8/giphy.gif)

Ai.ra is a **chatbot** (or chatterbot, but we can also say that Ai.ra is a **natural language processor**), i.e. it is a software application used to conduct an online chat conversation via text. Ai.ra is designed to simulate the way a **human (expert)** would behave during a round of questions and answers (**Q&A**). 

We can classify this type of system (**CUS - Conversation Understanding System**) into "*open domain systems*" and "*closed domain systems*". A closed domain system, also known as a domain-specific system, focuses on a particular set of topics and has limited responses. On the other hand, an open domain system encompasses (in principle) any topic. For example, **GPT-3** - the NLP model produced by OpenAI - **is capable of "chatting about virtually anything. "** 

**Ai.ra is a closed domain chatbot**, so don't even try to ask it what the square root of 25 is, it won't be able to help you (but its calculator can!). Ai.ra is designed to provide definitions and answer questions on topics related to **artificial intelligence (AI)**, **machine learning**, **AI ethics**, and **AI safety**, and this is her "*domain*". 

Ai.ra has **three iterations**, the first and second iterations were trained by machine learning (it used a **Bayesian neural network** and an **LSTM** trained through **supervised learning**), while the third iteration was created from **pre-set rules** (n-gram analysis + dictionary search). For its LSTM version, the word embeddings provided by the
[NILC (NÃºcleo Interinstitucional de LinguÃ­stica Computacional) Word Embeddings Repository](http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/nilc/index.php/repositorio-de-word-embeddings-do-nilc).
