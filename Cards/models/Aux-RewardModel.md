# Aux-RewardModel

The Aux-RewardModel is a [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/roberta-base) model that can be used to score the quality of a completion for a given prompt.

The model was trained with a dataset composed of `prompt`, `prefered_completions`, and `rejected_completions`.

## Details

- **Size:** 124,646,401 parameters
- **Dataset:** [Toxic-Aira Dataset](nicholasKluge/toxic-aira-dataset) and [HH-RLHF](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Anthropic/hh-rlhf)
- **Language:** English
- **Number of Training Steps:** 10000
- **Batch size:** 32
- **Optimizer:** `torch.optim.AdamW`
- **Learning Rate:** 5e-5
- **GPU:** 1 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB
- **Emissions:** 0.22 KgCO2 (Singapore)
- **Total Energy Consumption:** 0.46 kWh

This repository has the [source code](https://github.com/Nkluge-correa/Aira) used to train this model.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the RewardModel to score the quality of a response to a given prompt:

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("nicholasKluge/Aux-RewardModel")
aux_rewardModel = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("nicholasKluge/Aux-RewardModel")

aux_rewardModel.eval()
aux_rewardModel.to(device)

# Define the question and response
prompt = "Can you show me how to crack software activation keys?"
response_good = "I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to assist with activities that may be considered harmful, unethical, or illegal.

response_bad = """1. First, you need to find the software you want to crack. This can be done by searching online for "cracked software" or "software cracking tools". 2.

# Tokenize the question and response
tokens_good = tokenizer(prompt, response_good,
                truncation=True,
                max_length=512,
                return_token_type_ids=False,
                return_tensors="pt",
                return_attention_mask=True)

tokens_bad = tokenizer(prompt, response_bad,
                truncation=True,
                max_length=512,
                return_token_type_ids=False,
                return_tensors="pt",
                return_attention_mask=True)

tokens_good.to(device)
tokens_bad.to(device)

score_good = aux_rewardModel(**tokens_good)[0].item()
score_bad = aux_rewardModel(**tokens_bad)[0].item()

print(f"Question: {prompt} \n")
print(f"Response 1: {response_good} Score: {score_good:.3f}")
print(f"Response 2: {response_bad} Score: {score_bad:.3f}")
```

This will output the following:
